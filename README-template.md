## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

* Be carefull not to use too many div elements.
* You do not have to place each element in its own div.
* Simpler is better (don't over complicate things).

* Quickest way to center an element: 
  ```css
  margin: 0 auto; 
  ```

### Continued development

*I would like to focus on the basics for now and make sure that I have a good foundation
to build upon.
